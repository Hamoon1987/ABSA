## ABSA using Pars-BERT on Pars-ABSA dataset
Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a more detailed task in sentiment analysis, by identifying opinion polarity toward a certain aspect in a text. This method is attracting more attention from the community, due to the fact that it provides more thorough and useful information. However, there are few language-specific researches on Persian language. The present research aims to improve the ABSA on the Persian Pars-ABSA dataset. This research shows the potential of using pre-trained BERT model and taking advantage of using sentence-pair input on an ABSA task. The results indicate that employing Pars-BERT pre-trained model along with natural language inference auxiliary sentence (NLI-M) could boost the ABSA task accuracy up to 91% which is 5.5% (absolute) higher than state-of-the-art studies on Pars-ABSA dataset.

The code was developed and can be run on Google Colab. I used https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/ as the base code
The Pars-ABSA dataset can be found at https://github.com/Titowak/Pars-ABSA
